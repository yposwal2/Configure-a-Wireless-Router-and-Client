<h1>Configure a Wireless Router and Client</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

In this lab, I effectively completed a series of tasks to configure a home network using Cisco's Packet Tracer simulation. The process involved connecting devices, setting up the wireless router, configuring IP addresses, and testing connectivity. I established coaxial and Ethernet connections, personalized router settings for security, limited connected devices via DHCP, and enabled a secure wireless LAN. Finally, I verified successful connectivity for laptops and PCs, demonstrating a comprehensive understanding of network setup and management.
